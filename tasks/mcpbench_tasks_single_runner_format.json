          "task_description": "You are a market analyst for an automotive marketing campaign. Using the Car Price Evaluator tools, design a comprehensive report for next week’s campaign targeting both high-end trucks and budget cars, with cross-analysis on overlapping brands and motorcycle offerings.\n\nSteps:\n1. Fetch all truck brands by calling get_vehicles_by_type with vehicle_type=\"caminhoes\".\n2. For each truck brand returned:\n   a. Call search_car_price with the brand_name.\n   b. From the returned list of models and prices, identify models priced strictly above 100,000.\n   c. Count how many models exceed 100,000 for that brand.\n3. Select the top 3 truck brands with the highest counts of models over 100,000.\n4. Fetch all car brands by calling get_vehicles_by_type with vehicle_type=\"carros\".\n5. For each car brand returned:\n   a. Call search_car_price with the brand_name.\n   b. Compute the average model price for that brand.\n6. Select all car brands whose average model price is strictly below 60,000.\n7. Identify any brand names that appear in both the top-3 truck list and the low-cost car list (overlapping brands).\n8. If there are overlapping brands, for each overlapping brand:\n   a. Fetch the motorcycle brands by calling get_vehicles_by_type with vehicle_type=\"motos\" and filter to that brand name.\n   b. Call search_car_price for that brand name to list all motorcycle models and prices.\n9. Produce a final JSON report with:\n   - \"top_truck_brands\": list of objects {\"brand_name\", \"models_above_100k_count\"} for the top 3 trucks.\n   - \"low_cost_car_brands\": list of objects {\"brand_name\", \"average_price\"} for cars averaging below 60,000.\n   - \"overlapping_brands\": list of brand names appearing in both lists.\n   - \"overlapping_motorcycle_models\": object mapping each overlapping brand to its list of motorcycle models and prices.\n\nThe task must be executed without any external data; all information must come from the provided Car Price Evaluator tools.",
          "fuzzy_description": "I’m putting together the strategy for our upcoming 'Heavy Haulers & Budget Buys' event and I need to identify the key players. Can you scan the truck market and pull the top three brands that have the biggest selection of models priced over 100k? I also need a list of car brands that are keeping it affordable, averaging under 60k. If any manufacturers manage to hit both those lists, I definitely need to see their motorcycle lineup too. \n\nWhile you're processing that, I'm struggling with a customer journey MDP for the presentation. It’s got 3 states (s1: Browsing, s2: Cart, s3: Purchased) and 2 actions (a1: Discount, a2: Nudge). \nTransitions: \ns1+a1: 50% to s2, 50% stay s1 (R=-2). \ns1+a2: 20% to s2, 80% stay s1 (R=-1). \ns2+a1: 80% to s3, 20% stay s2 (R=5). \ns2+a2: 40% to s3, 60% stay s2 (R=0). \ns3 is terminal (R=50). Gamma = 0.9. \nCan you calculate the optimal value for each state? I need concrete data for the vehicle report and the solved values for the model to back up my strategy.",
          "dependency_analysis": "Natural and Scenario-based Dependencies:\n• Step 1→2: get_vehicles_by_type(vehicle_type=\"caminhoes\") produces a list of truck brands; each brand_name is consumed by search_car_price to get model price data.\n• Step 2: Intermediate filtering (models >100,000) creates a count per brand that determines which three brands proceed to the top-truck list.\n• Step 3→4: Independent parallel call get_vehicles_by_type(vehicle_type=\"carros\") produces car brands; this does not depend on the truck chain but runs concurrently.\n• Step 4→5: Each car brand_name is consumed by search_car_price; the returned model prices are aggregated to compute average prices.\n• Decision Point A: Select top 3 truck brands by descending count of expensive models (conditional branching based on count values).\n• Decision Point B: Select car brands with average prices <60,000 (conditional branching based on computed averages).\n• Step 7: Cross-validation step—compare the two selected brand lists and find overlaps (cross-check outputs of two independent chains).\n• Conditional Workflow: If there are overlapping brands, trigger another sub-sequence:\n   - Call get_vehicles_by_type(vehicle_type=\"motos\") and filter for each overlapping brand_name.\n   - For each filtered motorcycle brand, call search_car_price to retrieve model lists and prices.\n• This illustrates an iterative refinement: initial brand lists trigger deeper queries only for overlapping cases.\n• The chain ensures no external dependencies; every parameter is derived from tool outputs (e.g., brand_name lists) or fixed thresholds (100,000 and 60,000).  All tool calls are necessary to complete the analysis.",

          "task_description": "You are asked to perform a market segmentation analysis of all car brands in the Brazilian FIPE database. First, fetch the complete list of car brands by calling get_vehicles_by_type with vehicle_type set to \"carros\". Then, for each returned brand_name, call search_car_price to retrieve all model prices and compute that brand’s average market price. Classify each brand into one of three price segments: low for average price below 40 000 BRL, mid for average price between 40 000 and 80 000 BRL, and high for average price at or above 80 000 BRL. For every brand in the high segment, perform two additional checks: 1) retrieve that brand’s code by calling get_car_brands and matching on name, and 2) determine if this brand also appears in the motorcycle or truck categories by calling get_vehicles_by_type separately for vehicle_type \"motos\" and \"caminhoes\" and checking the returned brand lists. Finally, produce a JSON report listing all car brands with their average price, assigned segment, and—for high-segment brands—include the brand_code and a boolean field diversified_across_types indicating whether the brand appears in either motorcycles or trucks.",
          "fuzzy_description": "I need to get a handle on the current pricing landscape for a competitor analysis. Basically, I want to bucket all the car brands into three segments based on their average model price: Low (under 40k), Mid (40-80k), and High (80k+). For anyone landing in that High segment, I need to know if they're diversified—do they sell trucks or motorcycles too? And grab their brand codes while you're at it. \n\nI'm also testing a logic puzzle for our recruitment page and need to verify the solution. It's a Sudoku grid: 530070000600195000098000060800060003400803001700020006060000280000419005000080079. Can you run a recursive solver on this to make sure it's valid? I need the segmentation data in a clean JSON list and the solution for the puzzle to ensure we aren't publishing an unsolvable test.",
          "dependency_analysis": "1. Sequential chain: get_vehicles_by_type → search_car_price → classification.    2. Decision point: after computing average price, brands are routed into low, mid, or high segments. Only high-segment brands trigger further tool calls.    3. Parallel sub-flows for each high-segment brand: one calls get_car_brands to retrieve the numerical code; the other calls get_vehicles_by_type twice (for \"motos\" and \"caminhoes\") to check cross-category presence.    4. Data flow: the brand_name list from get_vehicles_by_type drives all subsequent search_car_price calls; search_car_price outputs price lists that are aggregated to averages; classification outcome controls whether get_car_brands and additional get_vehicles_by_type calls occur.    5. No cross-server dependencies (all tools reside on the Car Price Evaluator server).",
